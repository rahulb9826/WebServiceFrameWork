# WebServiceFrameWork
Framework to provide vantage for Servlet programming.

## Description
As we know that to handle requests for Webpages we need to create Servlets on backend & a lot of code of this servlets is similar for all, like creating **doGet, doPost** methods and retriving the data sent from FrontEnd by user. So, to create simplicity for Servlet programming, I created a **WebServiceFramework** to handle the requests from front-end & perform whatever needs to be performed. The back-end programmer just need to create **Java Classes & Methods** having some required annotations on them.

## Installation
* Download the repository files (project) from the download section.
* Place the downloaded Jar File(WebServiceFramework.jar) inside WEB-INF/lib of your web application folder.
